# ISXPortfolio Application Specifications

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for the ISXPortfolio web application.

## 2. Architecture

**2.1. Overall Architecture**

The application follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend.

* **Frontend:**  Flutter web application responsible for user interface and user experience.
* **Backend:** Go API server responsible for data management, business logic, and authentication.

**2.2. Components**

* **Frontend (Flutter):**
    * UI Components:  Reusable components for consistent design and user experience.
    * State Management: [State management solution - e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod] for managing application state.
    * API Service: Handles communication with the backend API.
    * Authentication Service: Manages user authentication using Google Authentication.
* **Backend (Go):**
    * API Endpoints: RESTful API endpoints for data access and manipulation.
    * Handlers: Functions that handle API requests and responses.
    * Data Access Layer: Interacts with the database (SQLite).
    * Authentication Middleware:  Verifies user authentication for protected endpoints.
* **Database (SQLite):**
    * Stores user data, portfolio information, watchlists, etc.

## 3. API Design

* **RESTful API:**  Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for data interaction.
* **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI documentation will be provided for all API endpoints.
* **Versioning:** API versioning will be implemented to ensure backward compatibility.

## 4. Authentication

* **Google Authentication:** Users will authenticate using their Google accounts.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  Used for secure authorization after successful login.

## 5. Deployment

* **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* **Containerization:** Docker will be used for containerizing both the frontend and backend.
* **CI/CD:**  A continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline will be implemented for automated deployments.

## 6. Testing

* **Unit Tests:**  Extensive unit tests will be written for both frontend and backend components.
* **Integration Tests:** Tests will be conducted to verify interactions between different components.
* **End-to-End Tests:**  End-to-end tests will simulate user interactions to ensure the entire application works as expected.

## 7. Security

* **Data Validation:**  Input validation will be performed to prevent malicious data.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented.
* **Data Protection:**  Sensitive data will be encrypted and stored securely.

## 8. Scalability

* **Database:**  The database can be migrated to a more scalable solution (e.g., PostgreSQL) as needed.
* **Backend:** The backend API can be scaled horizontally to handle increased traffic.
* **Caching:**  Caching mechanisms will be implemented to improve performance.

## 9. Monitoring and Logging

* **Logging:**  Comprehensive logging will be implemented for debugging and monitoring.
* **Monitoring:**  Monitoring tools will be used to track application performance and identify potential issues.
